# Beats Em Up

## What?

A simple program that prints the current time in .beats to stdout.

## Why?

I've been on the lookout for an easy intro to Rust project and here it is. I run a stream chatbot that can generate alerts based on the output of an external program. Right now, my `!beats` command is driven by a Python script, but neither using Python in Windows nor getting the chatbot to call out to a program in an interpreted language is any fun.
